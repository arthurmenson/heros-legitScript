# 🔧 Supabase Setup Guide

## Current Status: Database Connection Issues Detected

The system has been set up with fallback mechanisms, but for full functionality, you need to configure your Supabase project properly.

## 🚨 Issues Found

1. **Invalid Anon Key**: The current anon key is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with your real Supabase anon key
2. **Missing Database Setup**: The `users` table needs to be created in your Supabase database
3. **Authentication Configuration**: Supabase authentication needs to be configured

## 🛠️ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Real Supabase Configuration

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Select your project: `bvpyedvojwfnlztwqile`
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### Step 2: Update the Configuration

Edit `js/database.js` and replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
// Replace this line:
const SUPABASE_URL = `https://bvpyedvojwfnlztwqile.supabase.co`;

// And this function:
getAnonKey() {
  return 'YOUR_REAL_ANON_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with actual key from dashboard
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Database Table

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql`
3. Click **Run** to create the users table

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. Open `debug-database.html` in your browser
2. Click "Run All Tests" to verify everything works
3. Try creating a test user

## 🔄 Current Fallback System

**Good News**: Your account creation is still working! The system automatically falls back to localStorage when the database isn't available.

**What's happening now**:
- ✅ Quiz data is being saved
- ✅ User accounts are created in localStorage  
- ✅ Email validation still works
- ⚠️ Data will be stored locally until database connection is fixed

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Check Your Configuration
```bash
# Open debug page
open debug-database.html
```

### Common Issues

1. **"[object Object]" Error**
   - This is fixed! Better error messages are now shown
   - The debug page will show specific error details

2. **Connection Timeout**
   - Check if your Supabase project is active
   - Verify the project URL is correct

3. **Authentication Failed**
   - Make sure you're using the correct anon key
   - Check that Row Level Security policies are set up

4. **Table Not Found**
   - Run the SQL setup script in your Supabase dashboard
   - Make sure the `users` table exists

## 📊 Migration Path

Once you fix the database connection, existing localStorage data can be migrated:

1. Users stored in localStorage will continue to work
2. You can manually export/import the data if needed
3. The system will prefer database storage over localStorage

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Never commit your real anon key to public repositories
- Use environment variables in production
- The current setup is development-friendly with fallbacks

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The system works with localStorage fallback
2. **Short-term**: Get your real Supabase keys and update the config
3. **Long-term**: Set up proper authentication and user management

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```javascript
// In browser console
await window.db.testConnection()
await window.db.createUser({
  firstName: 'Test',
  lastName: 'User', 
  email: 'test@example.com',
  dateOfBirth: '1990-01-01'
})
```
